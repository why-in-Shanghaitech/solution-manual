## 1 Multiple choice

### Question 1

This question assumes that we are solving a shortest path problem.

A. DFS could return a path with any possible lengths.  
B. BFS will return a path with the smallest number of nodes.
C. UCS will return a path with the smallest total edge weight.
D. Greedy search could behave like a badly-guided DFS in the worst case.

### Question 2

A. BFS would take space complexity $O(b^d)$. (p.22, Slide 2, Fall 2023)
B. If a solution exists, then the depth will be finite. So iterative deepening is guaranteed to find the solution, thus complete. The completeness of iterative deepening is equivalent to that of BFS. (p.22, Slide 2, Fall 2023)
C. See p. 27, Slide 2, Fall 2023.
D. In tree search, A* is optimal if the heuristic is admissible. (p. 43-47, Slide 2, Fall 2023)
