## 1 Multiple choice

### Question 1

A. BFS takes $O(b^s)$ space. (p. 22, Slide 2, Fall 2023)  
B. It is correct.  
C. No, UCS requires that the edge weights are non-negative. Imagine that we have a graph with one edge of a large negative weight. If UCS does not explore this edge, then it will never find the optimal solution.  
D. Yes, it is correct. 3D maze is similar to a 2D maze.

### Question 2

A. Yes. Tree-Structured CSPs run time is $O(n d^2)$. (p. 41, Slide 3, Fall 2023)  
B. No. Remove backward takes place from leaf to root. (p. 42, Slide 3, Fall 2023) It is not possible to check AC before CF.  
C. No. It will be {red, orange, yellow}.  
D. Yes. A is possible to be assigned with green and F is possible to be assigned with red.
