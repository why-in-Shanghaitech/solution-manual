### Question 1

A. BFS takes $O(b^s)$ space. (p. 22, Slide 2, Fall 2023)  
B. It is correct.  
C. No, UCS requires that the edge weights are non-negative. Imagine that we have a graph with one edge of a large negative weight. If UCS does not explore this edge, then it will never find the optimal solution.  
D. Yes, it is correct. 3D maze is similar to a 2D maze.
